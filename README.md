# CalculatorProject

Here's my attempt at making a basic calculator application after trying out the notepad app. 

The calculator doesnt have a backspace function yet nor can it handle multiple operations in one go. 
Will work on that in the future. Appearantly it is not as easy as one would imagine it to be.
